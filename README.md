# The Javascript Lab Notebook #

*The Javascript lab notebook is [available here](http://www.ashi.works/javascript-lab-notebook).*

This notebook has a collection of lab specimens and notes findings to help you
learn Javascript by experiment.

I think you'll learn the most if you examine each specimen and try to thoroughly
understand it and answer the questions yourself before reading my notes.

You'll want to have a basic idea of Javascript structure and syntax before
starting on these. I like _[Speaking Javascript](http://speakingjs.com/es5/index.html)_.
It's freely available online, and so far, it seems accurate, precise, and in line
with current best practices. It's written by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer, who I'd
like to refer to as &#8220;Axel&#8221; or &#8220;Dr. Rose&#8221;. At a minimum,
I'd recommend reading Axel's [first chapter](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch01.html),
where he covers all the Javascript language features you will ever need.
